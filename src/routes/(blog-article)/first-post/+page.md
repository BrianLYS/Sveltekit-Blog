There are many developer blogs out there already, so this will be none of that. I'm not going to write about the latest technologies, or the best practices, or the most efficient ways to do things. 

I'm not going to write about the things I know, but about the things I don't know. I'm not going to write about the things I've done, but about the things I want to do.

I will talk about the impossible, the improbable, the unlikely. I will talk about the things that I dream of, the things that I fear, the things that I hope for. I will talk about the things that I believe in, the things that I doubt, the things that I question.

I believe in the power of writing as a tool for an intellectual discourse with oneself. I believe that writing is a way to organize thoughts, to clarify ideas, to express feelings, to share experiences, to learn from others, and to grow as a person.

For anyone who's reading this, if you find my work useful, thought provoking and would like to collaborate. Please let me know. I would love to hear from you.
